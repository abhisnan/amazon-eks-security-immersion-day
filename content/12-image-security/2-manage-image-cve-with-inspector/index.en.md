title : "Container Image CVE Management with Amazon Inspector"
weight : 40
---

In this workshop you will build a holistic vulnerability management solution suitable for container images. With thousands of new [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)](https://cve.mitre.org/) discovered every month, customers have told us that they struggle to keep on top of their security using traditional, on-premises patching solutions. The shift to containers only adds complexity to the already diverse IT environment. This workshop takes a deep dive into advanced image scanning capabilities using Amazon Inspector.

You will use native services and controls with AWS services such as [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/features/), [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/features/).
