---

In this workshop you will build a holistic vulnerability management solution suitable for container images. With thousands of new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are discovered every month, customers have told us that they struggle to keep on top of their security using traditional, on-premises patching solutions. The shift to containers only adds complexity to the already diverse IT environment. This workshop takes a deep dive into advanced image scanning capabilities using Amazon Inspector.

You will use native services and controls with AWS services such as [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/features/), [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/features/ and [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/features/)
