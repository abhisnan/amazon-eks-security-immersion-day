title : "Container Image CVE Management with Amazon Inspector and Security Hub"
weight : 34
---

In this workshop you will build a holistic vulnerability management solution suitable for container images. With thousands of new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are discovered every month, customers have told us that they struggle to keep on top of their security using traditional, on-premises patching solutions. The shift to containers only adds complexity to the already diverse IT environment. This workshop takes a deep dive into advanced image scanning capabilities using Amazon Inspector.

You will use native services and controls with AWS services such as [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/features/), [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/features/ and [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/features/)

## Prerequisites

This workshop is most suitable for participants who are currently building solutions in AWS using compute and/or container services.

## Target Audience

This workshop is designed for an audience looking to build vulnerability management solutions using AWS services and native controls. Technical owners and individual contributors in Platform teams, Security teams, and Cloud Architecture teams can use this workshop to build advanced vulnerability management configurations.


## Costs

In this workshop, you will create various AWS services. **This workshop will not incur any costs when run using AWS Event Dashboard at an AWS Event**.
