title : "Using AWS IAM Groups and Roles to Manage Kubernetes Cluster Access"

In this module, weâ€™ll learn about how to simplify access to different parts of the kubernetes clusters depending on AWS IAM Roles.


When an Amazon EKS cluster is created, the IAM entity (user or role) that creates the cluster is
permanently added to the Kubernetes RBAC authorization table as the administrator. This entity will be automatically part of the Kubernetes RBAC group called **system\:masters** and gets assigned to the [Kubernetes Default ClusterRole](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) called **cluster-admin**. The ClusterRole **cluster-admin** is the most powerful role and allows super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the role binding's namespace, including the namespace itself.

::alert[It is highly recommended not to add any Kubernetes user to **system\:masters** group unless it is necessary]{header="WARNING" type="warning"}

The identity of this entity isn't visible in your cluster configuration. So,
it's important to note the entity that created the cluster and make sure that you never delete it.


Initially, only the IAM entity that created the server can make calls to the Kubernetes API server using kubectl. If
you use the console to create the cluster, you must ensure that the same IAM credentials are in the AWS
SDK credential chain when you run kubectl commands on your cluster. After your cluster is created, you
can grant other IAM entities access to your cluster

Let us check the IAM role assigned to the Cloud 9 Instance.

```bash
C9_ROLE_ARN=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Arn)
IFS='/' read -r -a array <<< "$C9_ROLE_ARN"
C9_ROLE="${array[1]}"
echo "$C9_ROLE"
```

::::expand{header="Check Output if you running on your own"}
```bash
eksworkshop-admin
```
::::

::::expand{header="Check Output if you running at AWS Event"}
```bash
eks-security-workshop
```
::::


Note the IAM role `eksworkshop-admin` or  `eks-bootstrap-template-ws-Cloud9InstanceRole-V1RKIVUA1ZM0` in the above output is used to create and authenticate the Amazon EKS Cluster.

Let us check if this IAM role is part of the `aws-auth` config map in `kube-system` namespace.

```bash
DOES_ROLE_EXISTS_IN_CONFIGMAP=$(kubectl get cm aws-auth -n kube-system -oyaml | grep $C9_ROLE)
echo $DOES_ROLE_EXISTS_IN_CONFIGMAP

if [ -z "$DOES_ROLE_EXISTS_IN_CONFIGMAP" ]
then
      echo "$C9_ROLE doesn't exist in aws-auth config map in kube-system namespace"
else
      echo "$C9_ROLE exists in aws-auth config map in kube-system namespace"
fi
```

::expand[eks-bootstrap-template-ws-Cloud9InstanceRole-V1RKIVUA1ZM0 doesn't  exist in aws-auth configmap in kube-system namespace]{header="Check output"}

Note that the above IAM Role used to EKS cluster doesn't exist in `aws-auth`
 configmap, which is expected.

It is recommended to create a dedicated IAM role to create the EKS cluster with Least privileged IAM permissions to be able to perform CRUD operations on the EKS clusters. Howeever, the above IAM Role `eks-bootstrap-template-ws-Cloud9InstanceRole-V1RKIVUA1ZM0` has `AdministratorAccess`IAM permission for the lab purpose.
