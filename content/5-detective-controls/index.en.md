Collecting and analyzing [audit] logs is useful for a variety of different reasons. Logs can help with root cause analysis and attribution, i.e. ascribing a change to a particular user. When enough logs have been collected, they can be used to detect anomalous behaviors too. On EKS, the audit logs are sent to Amazon Cloudwatch Logs.
