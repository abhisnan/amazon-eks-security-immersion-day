* Disable Cloud9 AWS temporary credentials To ensure temporary credentials arenâ€™t already in place we will also remove any existing credentials file:
```bash
aws cloud9 update-environment  --environment-id $C9_PID --managed-credentials-action DISABLE
rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials
```
* Check if Cloud9 AWS temporary credentials is disabled
  * Open the **Preferences** tab.
  * Open the **AWS Settings** and see **AWS Managed Temporary Credentials** is **Off**, if not turn it **Off**
